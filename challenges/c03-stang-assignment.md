*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, nu_00, E_45, nu_45, E_90, nu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8
    ##   thick  E_00 nu_00  E_45  nu_45  E_90 nu_90 alloy

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
    pivot_longer(
      names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
      names_sep = "_",
      values_drop_na = TRUE,
      cols = c(-thick, -alloy)
      
      ) %>%
      filter(nu >=0)

df_stang_long$angle <- as.integer(df_stang_long$angle)


df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    nu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # … with 16 more rows

Use the following tests to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Names
assertthat::assert_that(
              setequal(
                df_stang_long %>% names,
                c("thick", "alloy", "angle", "E", "nu")
              )
            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
## Dimensions
assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
## Type
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_stang_long %>% pull(angle) %>% typeof()) == "integer"
            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

  

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
##
df_q2 <-
  df_stang_long %>%
   summarize(
      min_nu = min(nu), 
      max_nu = max(nu),
      min_E = min(E),
      max_E = max(E),
      sd_E = sd(E),
      sd_nu = sd(nu)
  )

df_q2
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   min_nu max_nu min_E max_E  sd_E   sd_nu
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1   0.31  0.331  9900 10700  268. 0.00674

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No, not for all aluminum because material properties vary with type
    of alloy, thickness and angle.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - One alloy because all the aluminum alloys are listed as al_24st
    under the “alloy” column.
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, and 90 degrees were tested.
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.081
- My question:
  - With a given thickness, how does mu change with angle?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here

df_stang_long_22 <-
  filter(df_stang_long, thick == 0.022) 

df_stang_long_32 <-
  filter(df_stang_long, thick == 0.032) 

df_stang_long_64 <-
  filter(df_stang_long, thick == 0.064)

df_stang_long_81 <-
  filter(df_stang_long, thick == 0.081) 


ggplot(df_stang_long_22) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = angle , y = nu))+
  ggtitle("Angle vs. Mu for 0.022 thickness Al")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(df_stang_long_32) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = angle , y = nu))+
  ggtitle("Angle vs. Mu for 0.032 thickness Al")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(df_stang_long_64) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = angle , y = nu))+
  ggtitle("Angle vs. Mu for 0.064 thickness Al")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-3.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(df_stang_long_81) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = angle , y = nu))+
  ggtitle("Angle vs. Mu for 0.081 thickness Al")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-4.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Given a constant thickness, there seems to be no notable trend that we
  can point out with angle vs. nu. For some thicknesses, the data seems
  to either jump up or jump down when you increase angle from 0 to 45
  degrees. Also in our alloy data, measured nu varies greatly between
  samples of the same thickness. The paper also explains that there are
  “large discrepancies” between the measured nu values of two identical
  specimens because of the error in their calculations.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - This graph does not support the claim that E is an intensive
    property of the material. According to the graph, you can see that
    for each thickness of aluminum, data tends to cluster around a
    different Elastic modulus, notably for the 0.081 thickness, where
    the data clusters around the 10000 E value as compared to the other
    measurements clustering generally around the 10500 E value. Because
    E is supposed to be an intensive property of an Aluminum alloy, I
    wonder if this trend is due to a different alloy being used in
    mistake for the 0.081 thickness, or some error in measurements.
