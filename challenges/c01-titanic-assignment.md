*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
df_titanic
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 5
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154
    ## # … with 22 more rows

``` r
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- Variables in the data set are Class, Crew, Sex, Age, Survived, and n.

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - Yes. The Wikipedia said there was 2,224 people on board while the
    total number in the Titanic dataset was 2,201.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - The difference in number could be the lack of information about the
    other 23 members on the ship as the information about them could be
    lost over time. The data set could also exclude the people who were
    never found so we wouldn’t know if they had survived or not.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
df_survived <- df_titanic %>% filter(Survived == "Yes")
df_survived
```

    ## # A tibble: 16 × 5
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child Yes          5
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child Yes         11
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child Yes         13
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child Yes          0
    ##  5 1st   Female Child Yes          1
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child Yes         13
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child Yes         14
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child Yes          0
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult Yes         57
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult Yes         14
    ## 11 3rd   Male   Adult Yes         75
    ## 12 Crew  Male   Adult Yes        192
    ## 13 1st   Female Adult Yes        140
    ## 14 2nd   Female Adult Yes         80
    ## 15 3rd   Female Adult Yes         76
    ## 16 Crew  Female Adult Yes         20

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`

df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class)) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(fill = Sex, y = n)) + 
  ggtitle("Passengers that Survived the Titanic")
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- There seem to be the most number of crew and 1st class passengers that
  survived the Titanic with a little over 200 people each. 3rd class
  comes in third and the least number of passengers that survived was in
  2nd class. Among the four categories, more females survived than males
  except in Crew, where the majority that survived were males.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class)) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(fill = Sex, y = Prop)) + 
  ggtitle("Proportion of Passengers that Survived the Titanic")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The highest proportion of passengers that survived comes from 1st
  class with the second highest being 2nd, 3rd highest being 3rd, and
  least proportion surviving being the crew. Within each class the
  proportion of women that survived is higher than the proportion of men
  that survived.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - The “Prop” value is the proportion of passengers that survived
    within each class category added together so that all of the “Prop”
    values on the bar chart are greater than one. For example, the 1st
    class value is the sum of the proportion of adult women, adult men,
    and male and female children that survived in 1st class. This is
    fishy because we usually think of proportions as less than 1.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(fill = Sex, y = Prop), position = "dodge") + 
  facet_grid(.~ Class) + 
  ggtitle("Proportion of Passengers in each Class that Survived the Titanic")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Looking at this bar chart, we can see that there is a correlation
  between higher class and the proportion of people that survived the
  Titanic. A higher proportion of adults and children in first class
  survived, followed by second class, with the least proportion of
  survivors in the 3rd class and crew. The age and class group that
  fared the best were children in the first and second class, with 100%
  of them surviving. Females in the first and second class also did well
  with nearly all females in 1st class and a little over 80% of the
  females in 2nd class surviving. For all age and class groups,
  surviving females outnumbered surviving males. The age and class group
  that fared the worst were male adults in 2nd class, with a little
  under 12.5% of them surviving.
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - The new plot shows the the breakdowns within each class with the
    proportion of adult females, adult males, male children, and female
    children that survived. These proportions, as expected, are all less
    than 1. The fishy Q4 plot adds these proportions per class so that
    the “proportion” values are all greater than 1.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
