*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

*Note*: You will have seen all of these steps in `e-vis00-basics`. This challenge is *primarily* a practice run of the submission system. The Data Exploration part should be very simple.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without all files uploaded to GitHub.**

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Data Exploration

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

### **q1** Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below

diamonds 
  ggplot(diamonds)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

**Observations**:

-   Within this data set, there seems to be a positive exponential correlation with price and carat of the diamonds. As carat increases, the price seems to increase at a higher rate when studying the data visualizaion.
-   Looking at the data cluster, most of the diamonds in this data set have carats below 2.5 with relatively fewer diamonds above 2.5 carats.
-   In addition, we can tell from the vertical clusters of data at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 (and so on in 0.5 increments) that much of the diamond's carat values fall on these values. These resulted in visually "jagged" vertical edges to the visualization over the 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 carat marks respectively.
-   Looking at individual increments (1-1.5, 1.5-2, and 2-2.5 carats for example), the number of diamonds at these carat values taper off before spiking again. For example, there seems to be much less diamonds with 1.9 carats as as opposed to 1.6 carats.

### **q2** Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!

diamonds
  ggplot(diamonds)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut))
```

**Observations**:

-   From this visualization, it seems like the higher quality of cut, the higher the price of the diamond within this data set if you hold carat constant. This is shown from the high amounts of yellow bordering the upper edge of the data cluster (corresponding with ideal cuts) with green in the middle (very good) and dark blue at the bottom edge (fair).

# Communication

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

### **q3** *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![ced than the less idealTerminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

### **q4** *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

### **q5** *Submit* your work to Canvas

Navigate to your GitHub repository's website and find the URL that corresponds to your report. Submit this to Canvas to complete the assignment.

### **q6** *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

If your team is on-deck, you are responsible for putting together a discussion of the challenge. I'll demonstrate how to do this by leading the discussion of Challenge 0.
